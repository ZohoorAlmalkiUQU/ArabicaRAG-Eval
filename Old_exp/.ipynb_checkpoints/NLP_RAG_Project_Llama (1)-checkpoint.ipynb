            "السيخية (بالبنجابيَّة: ਸਿੱਖੀ) هي ديانة توحيدية دارميَّة نشأت في شمالي الهند في نهاية القرن الخامس عشر. وتأتي كلمة «سيخية» من كلمة «سيخ» وهي بدورها تأتي من الجذر السنسكريتي التي تعني التلميذ و في اللغة البالية المريد أو التابع. وهي واحدة من أحدث الأديان الرئيسية في العالم، وهي واحدة من أكبر الديانات في العالم. وتتضمن المعتقدات الأساسية للسيخية، والتي وضِحَت في كتابهم المقدس جورو جرانث صاحب، الإيمان والتأمل في اسم الخالق الواحد، والوحدة الإلهية والمساواة للبشرية جمعاء، والانخراط في خدمة نكران الذات، والسعي لتحقيق العدالة لمصلحة الجميع وازدهارها، وإتباع سلوك معيشة صادق. وفي أوائل القرن الواحد والعشرين كان هناك حوالي 25 مليون سيخي في جميع أنحاء العالم، وتعيش الغالبية العظمى أو 76% (20 مليون) من السيخ في البنجاب، موطن السيخ في شمال غرب الهند، ويعيش حوالي مليوني في الدول الهندية المجاورة، والتي كانت جزءاً من ولاية البنجاب الهندية سابقاً. وسبب انتشارها في العالم هو اعتماد الإنجليز عليهم في بعض الحروب وهجرات السيخ خارج بلادهم، حيث بدأت الهجرة السيخية من الهند البريطانية خلال النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر، عندما أكمل البريطانيون ضمهم للبنجاب.\n",
            "تستند السيخية على التعاليم الروحية لمؤسس الديانة وهو الغورو ناناك، وخلفائه التسعة من الغورو البشر. لقب غورو يعني بالهندية المعلم. أما الغورو غورو جوبيند سينغ الملقب بالعاشر، ساهم في الكثير من أجل السيخية، وكان إسهامه في الإضفاء المستمر للطابع الرسمي على الديانة التي أسسها أولًا الغورو السيخ ناناك ديف جي في القرن الخامس عشر إسهامًا جديرًا بالملاحظة. وسمى الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب كخليفة له، وبالتالي أنهى خط الغورو البشر وجعل ن الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب الدليل الروحي الديني والدينوي للسيخ. وترفض الديانة السيخية الادعاءات بأن أي تقليد ديني معين له احتكار للحقيقة المطلقة. وتطورت السيخية في أوقات الاضطهاد الديني. حيث تعرض اثنان من أتباع السيخ وهم الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور للتعذيب وأعدم من قبل حكام المغول بعد رفضهم اعتناق الإسلام. وأثار اضطهاد السيخ تأسيس الخالسا كطلب لحماية حرية الضمير والدين.\n",
            "التاريخ.\n",
            "يرتبط تاريخ السيخية ارتباطًا وثيقًا بتاريخ منطقة البنجاب والوضع الاجتماعي السياسي في شمال غرب شبه القارة الهندية في القرن السادس عشر. منذ الحكم المغولي للهند على يد الإمبراطور جهانكير (1605-1707)، كانت السيخية في صراع مع قوانين إمبراطورية المغول، لأنها كانت تؤثر في التعاقب السياسي للمغول في حين تعتز بالأولياء من الإسلام. قُتل العديد من السيخ البارزين على يد حكام المغول لرفضهم الانصياع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ. من مجموع 10 من الغورو السيخ، عُذب وأُعدم اثنان من المعلمين أنفسهم (الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور)، وأقرباء مقربين للعديد من الغورو السيخ قُتلو بوحشية دون رحمة (مثل أبناء الغورو جوبيند سينغ البالغين من العمر 6 و9 سنوات)، إلى جانب العديد من الشخصيات الرئيسية الأخرى السيخية التي عُذبت وقُتلت (مثل باندا بهادور، بهاي ماتي داس، بهاي ساتي داس وباهاي ديالا)، على يد الحكام المغول المتجبرين لرفضهم الخضوع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ والهندوس. بعد ذلك، عسكرت السيخية لمعارضة هيمنة المغول على أرضهم.\n",
            "تميّز ظهور الكونفدرالية السيخية تحت حكم الأمراء والسيخ تحت حكم المهراجا رانجيت سينغ بالتسامح الديني والتعايش السلمي والتعددية مع المسيحيين والمسلمين والهندوس في مواقع السلطة. يعد تأسيس إمبراطورية السيخ عادةً ذروة السيخية على المستوى السياسي، خلال هذه الفترة جاءت إمبراطورية السيخ لتشمل كشمير (أقصى شمال شبه القارة الهندية)، ولداخ (إقليم اتحادي تديره الهند)، وبيشاور (هي عاصمة مقاطعة خيبر بختونخوا الباكستانية وأكبر مدنها). اعتنق عدد من الفلاحين المسلمين والهندوس السيخية. أخذ هاري سينغ نالوا، القائد العام لجيش السيخ على طول الحدود الشمالية الغربية، حدود إمبراطورية السيخ إلى مصب ممر خيبر (هو ممر جبلي في شمال غرب باكستان، على الحدود مع أفغانستان). دمجت الإدارة العلمانية لإمبراطورية السيخ إصلاحات عسكرية واقتصادية وحكومية مبتكرة.\n",
            "شهدت الأشهر التي سبقت تقسيم الهند (تقسيم الهند البريطانية إلى دولتين مستقلتين، الهند وباكستان) سنة 1947، صراعًا حادًا في البنجاب (منطقة جيوسياسية وثقافية وتاريخية في جنوب آسيا، تحديدًا شمال شبه القارة الهندية، وتضم مناطق في شرق باكستان وشمال الهند) بين السيخ والمسلمين، شهد الهجرة الدينية الفعالة للسيخ البنجاب والهندوس من البنجاب الغربية مقابل هجرة دينية مماثلة للمسلمين البنجاب في شرق البنجاب. في الوقت الحاضر، يعيش غالبية السيخ في ولاية البنجاب في الهند.\n",

            "\"العنف ضد كبار السن\" هو مصطلح يشير إلى السلوك العدواني والعنيف ضد كبار السن والذي من شأنه أن يسبب لهم العديد من الأضرار على المستويين النفسي والجسدي. قد يتم العنف ضد كبار السن في أي مكانً كان وعلى يدي أي شخص فهو لا ينطوي على شكل أو سبب واحد وهو يعتبر ظاهرة عالمية واسعة الانتشار ومن القضايا المجتمعية الرئيسية والتي تُقلِق المحاكم الدولية والمجتمعية وتدفعها باستمرار للبحث عن طرق للحفاظ على حقوق هؤلاء المُسنين وحمايتهم منه. كبار السن حسب تعريف دولة اسرائيل هم الأشخاص الذي يتجاوز عمرهم ال 65 سنة وهم أشخاص يحصلون على امتيازات وحماية مكثفة في اسرائيل وذلك بحسب التعديل رقم 26 لقانون العقوبات وهو قانون حماية القاصرين والعاجزين كما ويعود ذلك لضعفهم ولكثرة احتياجاتهم والتحديات التي يواجهها قسم كبير منهم. في دولة اسرائيل يتم التفريق بين مصطلح \"العنف ضد كبار السن\" وبين مصطلح \"إساءة وإهمال كبار السن\" حيث أنه وعلى الرغم من أن الإساءة لكبار السن قد تضمن العنف إلا أنها عادة ما تحدث من شخص مقرب لكبير السن مثل الأقرباء والأشخاص المخصصين لرعايتهم وتستمر لفترة وهو ضمن مجال عمل وزارة الرفاه والضمان الاجتماعي، على عكس مصطلح العنف ضد كبار السن والذي يدل على حادث الذي فيه يتم التهجم على شخص كبير بالسن من قبل شخص غريب ويحدث ذلك لمرة واحدة ويكون ضمن مجال عمل الشرطة. من الجدير بالذكر أن دولة إسرائيل تقوم باتخاذ الإجراءات اللازمة في كلتا الحالتين، سواء كانت إساءة او عنف، بهدف الحد من ظاهرة العنف ضد كبار السن. إحصائيات العنف ضد كبار السن. حسب التقرير الذي أصدرته الكنيست عام 2007 والذي يعرض ظاهرة العنف ضد كبار السن فأنه وفقًا للإحصائيات التي أجريت في نهاية سنة 2006 عاش ما يقارب ال 70،000 مُسن في اسرائيل وهذا يعادل 10% من إجمالي السكان، 30% منهم هم ناجون من المحرقة اليهودية او الهولوكوست كما ان حوالي 12،000 من كبار السن يعيشون مع شخص واحد على الأقل لا تربطه معهم صلة دم (عادة ما يكون هذا الشخص معالج او مرافق للاعتناء بهم). مراكز الشرطة تتلقى عدد هائل من البلاغات وفتحت ما يقارب 12,228 ملف يتعلق بالعنف والجرائم ضد كبار السن من عام 2002 حتى الرابع من سبتمبر عام 2007 (هذه الملفات تتضمن القتل، محاولات القتل، الجرائم الجنسية والاغتصاب، جرائم السرقة والسطو على البيوت كما وتتضمن الاعتداء والتخريب) هذا العدد من الشكاوي والملفات لا يتضمن أولئك الذين وصلوا إلى الحرس المدني وغيرها من الأقسام. بحسب الاحصائيات فإن: 32% من هذه الشكاوى هي بلاغات عن السطو على بيوتهم، 17% هي عن تهديدات تلقوها، 31% عن سرقات تعرضوا لها بينما 11% هي فقط اعتداءات جسدية. بشكل عام في تلك السنوات (2002-2007) كان يقدم كبار السن القادمون جديدًا للدولة (المهاجرون) حوالي 9% من الشكاوى رغم أن نسبتهم من السكان لا تتعدى 25% بينما المسنين العرب كانوا يقدمون 5% من البلاغات. وفقًا لوزارة الرفاه والضمان الاجتماعي إن لجائحة كورونا أثرًا سلبيًا على ظاهرة العنف ضد كبار السن فقد لوحظ ارتفاع في الحالات التي تم فيها تعنيف كبار السن (معظمها تمت من قبل أفراد العائلة ومقدمي الرعاية) فعلى سبيل المثال في عام 2018 تم علاج 6707 حالة بينما حتى منتصف عام 2019 فقط تم علاج أكثر من 7000 حالة وهذا عدا عن الحالات التي\n"

              "13845  السيخية (بالبنجابيَّة: ਸਿੱਖੀ) هي ديانة توحيدية دارميَّة نشأت في شمالي الهند في نهاية القرن الخامس عشر. وتأتي كلمة «سيخية» من كلمة «سيخ» وهي بدورها تأتي من الجذر السنسكريتي التي تعني التلميذ و في اللغة البالية المريد أو التابع. وهي واحدة من أحدث الأديان الرئيسية في العالم، وهي واحدة من أكبر الديانات في العالم. وتتضمن المعتقدات الأساسية للسيخية، والتي وضِحَت في كتابهم المقدس جورو جرانث صاحب، الإيمان والتأمل في اسم الخالق الواحد، والوحدة الإلهية والمساواة للبشرية جمعاء، والانخراط في خدمة نكران الذات، والسعي لتحقيق العدالة لمصلحة الجميع وازدهارها، وإتباع سلوك معيشة صادق. وفي أوائل القرن الواحد والعشرين كان هناك حوالي 25 مليون سيخي في جميع أنحاء العالم، وتعيش الغالبية العظمى أو 76% (20 مليون) من السيخ في البنجاب، موطن السيخ في شمال غرب الهند، ويعيش حوالي مليوني في الدول الهندية المجاورة، والتي كانت جزءاً من ولاية البنجاب الهندية سابقاً. وسبب انتشارها في العالم هو اعتماد الإنجليز عليهم في بعض الحروب وهجرات السيخ خارج بلادهم، حيث بدأت الهجرة السيخية من الهند البريطانية خلال النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر، عندما أكمل البريطانيون ضمهم للبنجاب.\\nتستند السيخية على التعاليم الروحية لمؤسس الديانة وهو الغورو ناناك، وخلفائه التسعة من الغورو البشر. لقب غورو يعني بالهندية المعلم. أما الغورو غورو جوبيند سينغ الملقب بالعاشر، ساهم في الكثير من أجل السيخية، وكان إسهامه في الإضفاء المستمر للطابع الرسمي على الديانة التي أسسها أولًا الغورو السيخ ناناك ديف جي في القرن الخامس عشر إسهامًا جديرًا بالملاحظة. وسمى الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب كخليفة له، وبالتالي أنهى خط الغورو البشر وجعل ن الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب الدليل الروحي الديني والدينوي للسيخ. وترفض الديانة السيخية الادعاءات بأن أي تقليد ديني معين له احتكار للحقيقة المطلقة. وتطورت السيخية في أوقات الاضطهاد الديني. حيث تعرض اثنان من أتباع السيخ وهم الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور للتعذيب وأعدم من قبل حكام المغول بعد رفضهم اعتناق الإسلام. وأثار اضطهاد السيخ تأسيس الخالسا كطلب لحماية حرية الضمير والدين.\\nالتاريخ.\\nيرتبط تاريخ السيخية ارتباطًا وثيقًا بتاريخ منطقة البنجاب والوضع الاجتماعي السياسي في شمال غرب شبه القارة الهندية في القرن السادس عشر. منذ الحكم المغولي للهند على يد الإمبراطور جهانكير (1605-1707)، كانت السيخية في صراع مع قوانين إمبراطورية المغول، لأنها كانت تؤثر في التعاقب السياسي للمغول في حين تعتز بالأولياء من الإسلام. قُتل العديد من السيخ البارزين على يد حكام المغول لرفضهم الانصياع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ. من مجموع 10 من الغورو السيخ، عُذب وأُعدم اثنان من المعلمين أنفسهم (الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور)، وأقرباء مقربين للعديد من الغورو السيخ قُتلو بوحشية دون رحمة (مثل أبناء الغورو جوبيند سينغ البالغين من العمر 6 و9 سنوات)، إلى جانب العديد من الشخصيات الرئيسية الأخرى السيخية التي عُذبت وقُتلت (مثل باندا بهادور، بهاي ماتي داس، بهاي ساتي داس وباهاي ديالا)، على يد الحكام المغول المتجبرين لرفضهم الخضوع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ والهندوس. بعد ذلك، عسكرت السيخية لمعارضة هيمنة المغول على أرضهم.\\nتميّز ظهور الكونفدرالية السيخية تحت حكم الأمراء والسيخ تحت حكم المهراجا رانجيت سينغ بالتسامح الديني والتعايش السلمي والتعددية مع المسيحيين والمسلمين والهندوس في مواقع السلطة. يعد تأسيس إمبراطورية السيخ عادةً ذروة السيخية على المستوى السياسي، خلال هذه الفترة جاءت إمبراطورية السيخ لتشمل كشمير (أقصى شمال شبه القارة الهندية)، ولداخ (إقليم اتحادي تديره الهند)، وبيشاور (هي عاصمة مقاطعة خيبر بختونخوا الباكستانية وأكبر مدنها). اعتنق عدد من الفلاحين المسلمين والهندوس السيخية. أخذ هاري سينغ نالوا، القائد العام لجيش السيخ على طول الحدود الشمالية الغربية، حدود إمبراطورية السيخ إلى مصب ممر خيبر (هو ممر جبلي في شمال غرب باكستان، على الحدود مع أفغانستان). دمجت الإدارة العلمانية لإمبراطورية السيخ إصلاحات عسكرية واقتصادية وحكومية مبتكرة.\\nشهدت الأشهر التي سبقت تقسيم الهند (تقسيم الهند البريطانية إلى دولتين مستقلتين، الهند وباكستان) سنة 1947، صراعًا حادًا في البنجاب (منطقة جيوسياسية وثقافية وتاريخية في جنوب آسيا، تحديدًا شمال شبه القارة الهندية، وتضم مناطق في شرق باكستان وشمال الهند) بين السيخ والمسلمين، شهد الهجرة الدينية الفعالة للسيخ البنجاب والهندوس من البنجاب الغربية مقابل هجرة دينية مماثلة للمسلمين البنجاب في شرق البنجاب. في الوقت الحاضر، يعيش غالبية السيخ في ولاية البنجاب في الهند.\\nالخمسة كاكارس أو الكافات الخمسة.\\nالخمسة كافات هم يصرون على الألتزام بها وعندهم من لا يلتزم بالكافات الخمس يصفوه بصفة باتت patitأي المرتد، ومن يدخل السيخية جديد يجعلوه يتعود عليها ويسموه المتكيف البطئ.\\nالغورو السيخ.\\nالغورو كلمة تعني المعلم وهم عشرة غورو للسيخية وهم:\\n   \n",

              "      <td>السيخية (بالبنجابيَّة: ਸਿੱਖੀ) هي ديانة توحيدية دارميَّة نشأت في شمالي الهند في نهاية القرن الخامس عشر. وتأتي كلمة «سيخية» من كلمة «سيخ» وهي بدورها تأتي من الجذر السنسكريتي التي تعني التلميذ و في اللغة البالية المريد أو التابع. وهي واحدة من أحدث الأديان الرئيسية في العالم، وهي واحدة من أكبر الديانات في العالم. وتتضمن المعتقدات الأساسية للسيخية، والتي وضِحَت في كتابهم المقدس جورو جرانث صاحب، الإيمان والتأمل في اسم الخالق الواحد، والوحدة الإلهية والمساواة للبشرية جمعاء، والانخراط في خدمة نكران الذات، والسعي لتحقيق العدالة لمصلحة الجميع وازدهارها، وإتباع سلوك معيشة صادق. وفي أوائل القرن الواحد والعشرين كان هناك حوالي 25 مليون سيخي في جميع أنحاء العالم، وتعيش الغالبية العظمى أو 76% (20 مليون) من السيخ في البنجاب، موطن السيخ في شمال غرب الهند، ويعيش حوالي مليوني في الدول الهندية المجاورة، والتي كانت جزءاً من ولاية البنجاب الهندية سابقاً. وسبب انتشارها في العالم هو اعتماد الإنجليز عليهم في بعض الحروب وهجرات السيخ خارج بلادهم، حيث بدأت الهجرة السيخية من الهند البريطانية خلال النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر، عندما أكمل البريطانيون ضمهم للبنجاب.\\nتستند السيخية على التعاليم الروحية لمؤسس الديانة وهو الغورو ناناك، وخلفائه التسعة من الغورو البشر. لقب غورو يعني بالهندية المعلم. أما الغورو غورو جوبيند سينغ الملقب بالعاشر، ساهم في الكثير من أجل السيخية، وكان إسهامه في الإضفاء المستمر للطابع الرسمي على الديانة التي أسسها أولًا الغورو السيخ ناناك ديف جي في القرن الخامس عشر إسهامًا جديرًا بالملاحظة. وسمى الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب كخليفة له، وبالتالي أنهى خط الغورو البشر وجعل ن الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب الدليل الروحي الديني والدينوي للسيخ. وترفض الديانة السيخية الادعاءات بأن أي تقليد ديني معين له احتكار للحقيقة المطلقة. وتطورت السيخية في أوقات الاضطهاد الديني. حيث تعرض اثنان من أتباع السيخ وهم الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور للتعذيب وأعدم من قبل حكام المغول بعد رفضهم اعتناق الإسلام. وأثار اضطهاد السيخ تأسيس الخالسا كطلب لحماية حرية الضمير والدين.\\nالتاريخ.\\nيرتبط تاريخ السيخية ارتباطًا وثيقًا بتاريخ منطقة البنجاب والوضع الاجتماعي السياسي في شمال غرب شبه القارة الهندية في القرن السادس عشر. منذ الحكم المغولي للهند على يد الإمبراطور جهانكير (1605-1707)، كانت السيخية في صراع مع قوانين إمبراطورية المغول، لأنها كانت تؤثر في التعاقب السياسي للمغول في حين تعتز بالأولياء من الإسلام. قُتل العديد من السيخ البارزين على يد حكام المغول لرفضهم الانصياع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ. من مجموع 10 من الغورو السيخ، عُذب وأُعدم اثنان من المعلمين أنفسهم (الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور)، وأقرباء مقربين للعديد من الغورو السيخ قُتلو بوحشية دون رحمة (مثل أبناء الغورو جوبيند سينغ البالغين من العمر 6 و9 سنوات)، إلى جانب العديد من الشخصيات الرئيسية الأخرى السيخية التي عُذبت وقُتلت (مثل باندا بهادور، بهاي ماتي داس، بهاي ساتي داس وباهاي ديالا)، على يد الحكام المغول المتجبرين لرفضهم الخضوع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ والهندوس. بعد ذلك، عسكرت السيخية لمعارضة هيمنة المغول على أرضهم.\\nتميّز ظهور الكونفدرالية السيخية تحت حكم الأمراء والسيخ تحت حكم المهراجا رانجيت سينغ بالتسامح الديني والتعايش السلمي والتعددية مع المسيحيين والمسلمين والهندوس في مواقع السلطة. يعد تأسيس إمبراطورية السيخ عادةً ذروة السيخية على المستوى السياسي، خلال هذه الفترة جاءت إمبراطورية السيخ لتشمل كشمير (أقصى شمال شبه القارة الهندية)، ولداخ (إقليم اتحادي تديره الهند)، وبيشاور (هي عاصمة مقاطعة خيبر بختونخوا الباكستانية وأكبر مدنها). اعتنق عدد من الفلاحين المسلمين والهندوس السيخية. أخذ هاري سينغ نالوا، القائد العام لجيش السيخ على طول الحدود الشمالية الغربية، حدود إمبراطورية السيخ إلى مصب ممر خيبر (هو ممر جبلي في شمال غرب باكستان، على الحدود مع أفغانستان). دمجت الإدارة العلمانية لإمبراطورية السيخ إصلاحات عسكرية واقتصادية وحكومية مبتكرة.\\nشهدت الأشهر التي سبقت تقسيم الهند (تقسيم الهند البريطانية إلى دولتين مستقلتين، الهند وباكستان) سنة 1947، صراعًا حادًا في البنجاب (منطقة جيوسياسية وثقافية وتاريخية في جنوب آسيا، تحديدًا شمال شبه القارة الهندية، وتضم مناطق في شرق باكستان وشمال الهند) بين السيخ والمسلمين، شهد الهجرة الدينية الفعالة للسيخ البنجاب والهندوس من البنجاب الغربية مقابل هجرة دينية مماثلة للمسلمين البنجاب في شرق البنجاب. في الوقت الحاضر، يعيش غالبية السيخ في ولاية البنجاب في الهند.\\nالخمسة كاكارس أو الكافات الخمسة.\\nالخمسة كافات هم يصرون على الألتزام بها وعندهم من لا يلتزم بالكافات الخمس يصفوه بصفة باتت patitأي المرتد، ومن يدخل السيخية جديد يجعلوه يتعود عليها ويسموه المتكيف البطئ.\\nالغورو السيخ.\\nالغورو كلمة تعني المعلم وهم عشرة غورو للسيخية وهم:\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>الهندسة الكهربائية هي تخصص يهتم بدراسة وتطبيقات علوم الكهرباء والإلكترونيات والمجالات الكهرومغناطيسية.\\nأصبح هذا المجال معروفاً في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر وذلك بعد انتشار التلغراف ومحطات إمداد الطاقة. والآن يغطي هذا المجال عدداً من المواضيع الفرعية والتي تتضمن الطاقة والإلكترونيات ونظم التحكم الآلي ومعالجة الإشارات والاتصالات اللاسلكية.\\nومن الممكن أن نقول أن الهندسة الكهربائية قد تتضمن أيضاً هندسة الإلكترونيات وقد لا تتضمنها. ويمكن التفريق بينهما حيث تهتم هندسة الكهرباء بالأمور المتعلقة بنظم الكهرباء عالية الجهد مثل نقل الطاقة والتحكم في المحركات، بينما تتعامل هندسة الإلكترونيات مع دراسة النظم الإلكترونية ذات المقاييس المنخفضة (تيار منخفض –جهد منخفض)، ويتضمن ذلك علوم الحاسبات والدوائر المتكاملة.\\nوتتناول الهندسة الكهربائية دراسة وتصميم العديد من النظم الكهربائية والإلكترونية المختلفة، مثل الدوائر الكهربائية والمولدات، المحركات، المحولات، مولد القدرة غير المنقطعة UPS، المواد المغناطيسية وغيرها من الأجهزة الكهرومغناطيسية والكهروميكانيكية.\\nتاريخ وأعلام الهندسة الكهربائية.\\nظهر الاهتمام العلمي بالكهرباء منذ بدايات القرن السابع عشر على الأقل. فيعتقد أن أول مهندس كهرباء هو وليام جلبرت الذي صمم آلة لاكتشاف الأجسام ذات الشحنات الكهربية الساكنة. وهو من فرَّق بين المغناطيسية والكهربية الساكنة، كما يعتقد بأنه أول من أنشأ مصطلح الكهرباء.\\nوفي بادئ الأمر كانت كل الاكتشافات والاختراعات تتعلق بالشحنة. وبدأ فصل الهندسة الكهربائية عن الفيزياء في زمن توماس اديسون وفيرنر فون سيمنس. وفي عام 1752 اخترع بينيامين فرانكلين موصلة الصواعق ونشر بين 1751 و1753 نتائج تجاربه تحت عنوان «تجارب ومشاهدات عن الكهرباء» (Experiments and Observations on Electricity). في العام 1800 قام ألساندرو فولتا ببناء بطاريته الأولى المسماة «عمود فولتا» بعد اعجابه بتجربة اجراها لويجي جالفاني عام 1792. في العام 1820 قام هانز كريستيان اورستد بعمل تجارب عن انحناء ابرة البوصلة بتاثير التيار الكهربي. وفي نفس العام كرر اندريه ماري امبير تلك التجربة واثبت ان سلكين يمر فيهما التيار يؤثران بقوى على بعضهما البعض وعرف خلالها الجهد الكهربي والتيار الكهربي.\\nمايكل فاراداي (ينطق أيضا ميشيل فاراداي) قدم أعمال كبيرة في مجال الفيضين الكهربي والمغناطيسي، وعرف أيضا خطوط المجال. وبناء على أعمال فاراداي قدم جيمس كليرك ماكسويل أعمالا في إكمال نظرية الكهرومغناطيسية والكهروديناميكيةـ وقدم عام 1864 معادلات ماكسويل والتي تعتبر أحد أهم أسس الهندسة الكهربية.\\nتطور مجال إنتاج الطاقة الكهربائية والضوء في نفس السنوات أدت لزيادة الطلب على مهندسوا كهرباء ذوي تجربة. في نفس الفترة تم الحصول على المؤهلات الهندسية من خلال التخصصات بأطر أعمال هندسية. هذه الطريقة اهلت مهندسوا بناء ومهندسو ماكينات لكنها فشلت بان تؤهل مهندسوا كهرباء على ضوء تسارع المجال، ولم يكن هناك مهندسو كهرباء يدرسون الموضوع لطلاب هندسه الكهرباء. \\nبشكل طبيعي مهمة تعليم وتأهيل مهندسوا الكهرباء وقعت على عاتق الفيزيائين، حيث انه لم يكن لاحد اخر العلم بمجال الكهرباء المطلوب والقدرة لتوصيله لاكبر عدد من الطلاب.\\n</td>\n",

              "0  السيخية (بالبنجابيَّة: ਸਿੱਖੀ) هي ديانة توحيدية دارميَّة نشأت في شمالي الهند في نهاية القرن الخامس عشر. وتأتي كلمة «سيخية» من كلمة «سيخ» وهي بدورها تأتي من الجذر السنسكريتي التي تعني التلميذ و في اللغة البالية المريد أو التابع. وهي واحدة من أحدث الأديان الرئيسية في العالم، وهي واحدة من أكبر الديانات في العالم. وتتضمن المعتقدات الأساسية للسيخية، والتي وضِحَت في كتابهم المقدس جورو جرانث صاحب، الإيمان والتأمل في اسم الخالق الواحد، والوحدة الإلهية والمساواة للبشرية جمعاء، والانخراط في خدمة نكران الذات، والسعي لتحقيق العدالة لمصلحة الجميع وازدهارها، وإتباع سلوك معيشة صادق. وفي أوائل القرن الواحد والعشرين كان هناك حوالي 25 مليون سيخي في جميع أنحاء العالم، وتعيش الغالبية العظمى أو 76% (20 مليون) من السيخ في البنجاب، موطن السيخ في شمال غرب الهند، ويعيش حوالي مليوني في الدول الهندية المجاورة، والتي كانت جزءاً من ولاية البنجاب الهندية سابقاً. وسبب انتشارها في العالم هو اعتماد الإنجليز عليهم في بعض الحروب وهجرات السيخ خارج بلادهم، حيث بدأت الهجرة السيخية من الهند البريطانية خلال النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر، عندما أكمل البريطانيون ضمهم للبنجاب.\\nتستند السيخية على التعاليم الروحية لمؤسس الديانة وهو الغورو ناناك، وخلفائه التسعة من الغورو البشر. لقب غورو يعني بالهندية المعلم. أما الغورو غورو جوبيند سينغ الملقب بالعاشر، ساهم في الكثير من أجل السيخية، وكان إسهامه في الإضفاء المستمر للطابع الرسمي على الديانة التي أسسها أولًا الغورو السيخ ناناك ديف جي في القرن الخامس عشر إسهامًا جديرًا بالملاحظة. وسمى الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب كخليفة له، وبالتالي أنهى خط الغورو البشر وجعل ن الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب الدليل الروحي الديني والدينوي للسيخ. وترفض الديانة السيخية الادعاءات بأن أي تقليد ديني معين له احتكار للحقيقة المطلقة. وتطورت السيخية في أوقات الاضطهاد الديني. حيث تعرض اثنان من أتباع السيخ وهم الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور للتعذيب وأعدم من قبل حكام المغول بعد رفضهم اعتناق الإسلام. وأثار اضطهاد السيخ تأسيس الخالسا كطلب لحماية حرية الضمير والدين.\\nالتاريخ.\\nيرتبط تاريخ السيخية ارتباطًا وثيقًا بتاريخ منطقة البنجاب والوضع الاجتماعي السياسي في شمال غرب شبه القارة الهندية في القرن السادس عشر. منذ الحكم المغولي للهند على يد الإمبراطور جهانكير (1605-1707)، كانت السيخية في صراع مع قوانين إمبراطورية المغول، لأنها كانت تؤثر في التعاقب السياسي للمغول في حين تعتز بالأولياء من الإسلام. قُتل العديد من السيخ البارزين على يد حكام المغول لرفضهم الانصياع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ. من مجموع 10 من الغورو السيخ، عُذب وأُعدم اثنان من المعلمين أنفسهم (الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور)، وأقرباء مقربين للعديد من الغورو السيخ قُتلو بوحشية دون رحمة (مثل أبناء الغورو جوبيند سينغ البالغين من العمر 6 و9 سنوات)، إلى جانب العديد من الشخصيات الرئيسية الأخرى السيخية التي عُذبت وقُتلت (مثل باندا بهادور، بهاي ماتي داس، بهاي ساتي داس وباهاي ديالا)، على يد الحكام المغول المتجبرين لرفضهم الخضوع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ والهندوس. بعد ذلك، عسكرت السيخية لمعارضة هيمنة المغول على أرضهم.\\nتميّز ظهور الكونفدرالية السيخية تحت حكم الأمراء والسيخ تحت حكم المهراجا رانجيت سينغ بالتسامح الديني والتعايش السلمي والتعددية مع المسيحيين والمسلمين والهندوس في مواقع السلطة. يعد تأسيس إمبراطورية السيخ عادةً ذروة السيخية على المستوى السياسي، خلال هذه الفترة جاءت إمبراطورية السيخ لتشمل كشمير (أقصى شمال شبه القارة الهندية)، ولداخ (إقليم اتحادي تديره الهند)، وبيشاور (هي عاصمة مقاطعة خيبر بختونخوا الباكستانية وأكبر مدنها). اعتنق عدد من الفلاحين المسلمين والهندوس السيخية. أخذ هاري سينغ نالوا، القائد العام لجيش السيخ على طول الحدود الشمالية الغربية، حدود إمبراطورية السيخ إلى مصب ممر خيبر (هو ممر جبلي في شمال غرب باكستان، على الحدود مع أفغانستان). دمجت الإدارة العلمانية لإمبراطورية السيخ إصلاحات عسكرية واقتصادية وحكومية مبتكرة.\\nشهدت الأشهر التي سبقت تقسيم الهند (تقسيم الهند البريطانية إلى دولتين مستقلتين، الهند وباكستان) سنة 1947، صراعًا حادًا في البنجاب (منطقة جيوسياسية وثقافية وتاريخية في جنوب آسيا، تحديدًا شمال شبه القارة الهندية، وتضم مناطق في شرق باكستان وشمال الهند) بين السيخ والمسلمين، شهد الهجرة الدينية الفعالة للسيخ البنجاب والهندوس من البنجاب الغربية مقابل هجرة دينية مماثلة للمسلمين البنجاب في شرق البنجاب. في الوقت الحاضر، يعيش غالبية السيخ في ولاية البنجاب في الهند.\\nالخمسة كاكارس أو الكافات الخمسة.\\nالخمسة كافات هم يصرون على الألتزام بها وعندهم من لا يلتزم بالكافات الخمس يصفوه بصفة باتت patitأي المرتد، ومن يدخل السيخية جديد يجعلوه يتعود عليها ويسموه المتكيف البطئ.\\nالغورو السيخ.\\nالغورو كلمة تعني المعلم وهم عشرة غورو للسيخية وهم:\\n   \n",

              "      <td>الهندسة الكهربائية هي تخصص يهتم بدراسة وتطبيقات علوم الكهرباء والإلكترونيات والمجالات الكهرومغناطيسية.\\nأصبح هذا المجال معروفاً في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر وذلك بعد انتشار التلغراف ومحطات إمداد الطاقة. والآن يغطي هذا المجال عدداً من المواضيع الفرعية والتي تتضمن الطاقة والإلكترونيات ونظم التحكم الآلي ومعالجة الإشارات والاتصالات اللاسلكية.\\nومن الممكن أن نقول أن الهندسة الكهربائية قد تتضمن أيضاً هندسة الإلكترونيات وقد لا تتضمنها. ويمكن التفريق بينهما حيث تهتم هندسة الكهرباء بالأمور المتعلقة بنظم الكهرباء عالية الجهد مثل نقل الطاقة والتحكم في المحركات، بينما تتعامل هندسة الإلكترونيات مع دراسة النظم الإلكترونية ذات المقاييس المنخفضة (تيار منخفض –جهد منخفض)، ويتضمن ذلك علوم الحاسبات والدوائر المتكاملة.\\nوتتناول الهندسة الكهربائية دراسة وتصميم العديد من النظم الكهربائية والإلكترونية المختلفة، مثل الدوائر الكهربائية والمولدات، المحركات، المحولات، مولد القدرة غير المنقطعة UPS، المواد المغناطيسية وغيرها من الأجهزة الكهرومغناطيسية والكهروميكانيكية.\\nتاريخ وأعلام الهندسة الكهربائية.\\nظهر الاهتمام العلمي بالكهرباء منذ بدايات القرن السابع عشر على الأقل. فيعتقد أن أول مهندس كهرباء هو وليام جلبرت الذي صمم آلة لاكتشاف الأجسام ذات الشحنات الكهربية الساكنة. وهو من فرَّق بين المغناطيسية والكهربية الساكنة، كما يعتقد بأنه أول من أنشأ مصطلح الكهرباء.\\nوفي بادئ الأمر كانت كل الاكتشافات والاختراعات تتعلق بالشحنة. وبدأ فصل الهندسة الكهربائية عن الفيزياء في زمن توماس اديسون وفيرنر فون سيمنس. وفي عام 1752 اخترع بينيامين فرانكلين موصلة الصواعق ونشر بين 1751 و1753 نتائج تجاربه تحت عنوان «تجارب ومشاهدات عن الكهرباء» (Experiments and Observations on Electricity). في العام 1800 قام ألساندرو فولتا ببناء بطاريته الأولى المسماة «عمود فولتا» بعد اعجابه بتجربة اجراها لويجي جالفاني عام 1792. في العام 1820 قام هانز كريستيان اورستد بعمل تجارب عن انحناء ابرة البوصلة بتاثير التيار الكهربي. وفي نفس العام كرر اندريه ماري امبير تلك التجربة واثبت ان سلكين يمر فيهما التيار يؤثران بقوى على بعضهما البعض وعرف خلالها الجهد الكهربي والتيار الكهربي.\\nمايكل فاراداي (ينطق أيضا ميشيل فاراداي) قدم أعمال كبيرة في مجال الفيضين الكهربي والمغناطيسي، وعرف أيضا خطوط المجال. وبناء على أعمال فاراداي قدم جيمس كليرك ماكسويل أعمالا في إكمال نظرية الكهرومغناطيسية والكهروديناميكيةـ وقدم عام 1864 معادلات ماكسويل والتي تعتبر أحد أهم أسس الهندسة الكهربية.\\nتطور مجال إنتاج الطاقة الكهربائية والضوء في نفس السنوات أدت لزيادة الطلب على مهندسوا كهرباء ذوي تجربة. في نفس الفترة تم الحصول على المؤهلات الهندسية من خلال التخصصات بأطر أعمال هندسية. هذه الطريقة اهلت مهندسوا بناء ومهندسو ماكينات لكنها فشلت بان تؤهل مهندسوا كهرباء على ضوء تسارع المجال، ولم يكن هناك مهندسو كهرباء يدرسون الموضوع لطلاب هندسه الكهرباء. \\nبشكل طبيعي مهمة تعليم وتأهيل مهندسوا الكهرباء وقعت على عاتق الفيزيائين، حيث انه لم يكن لاحد اخر العلم بمجال الكهرباء المطلوب والقدرة لتوصيله لاكبر عدد من الطلاب.\\n</td>\n",

Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius. Albert Einstein, born on 14 March 1879, was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of\n",

            "0  [السيخية (بالبنجابيَّة: ਸਿੱਖੀ) هي ديانة توحيدية دارميَّة نشأت في شمالي الهند في نهاية القرن الخامس عشر. وتأتي كلمة «سيخية» من كلمة «سيخ» وهي بدورها تأتي من الجذر السنسكريتي التي تعني التلميذ و في اللغة البالية المريد أو التابع. وهي واحدة من أحدث الأديان الرئيسية في العالم، وهي واحدة من أكبر الديانات في العالم. وتتضمن المعتقدات الأساسية للسيخية، والتي وضِحَت في كتابهم المقدس جورو جرانث صاحب، الإيمان والتأمل في اسم الخالق الواحد، والوحدة الإلهية والمساواة للبشرية جمعاء، والانخراط في خدمة نكران الذات، والسعي لتحقيق العدالة لمصلحة الجميع وازدهارها، وإتباع سلوك معيشة صادق. وفي أوائل القرن الواحد والعشرين كان هناك حوالي 25 مليون سيخي في جميع أنحاء العالم، وتعيش الغالبية العظمى أو 76% (20 مليون) من السيخ في البنجاب، موطن السيخ في شمال غرب الهند، ويعيش حوالي مليوني في الدول الهندية المجاورة، والتي كانت جزءاً من ولاية البنجاب الهندية سابقاً. وسبب انتشارها في العالم هو اعتماد الإنجليز عليهم في بعض الحروب وهجرات السيخ خارج بلادهم، حيث بدأت الهجرة السيخية من الهند البريطانية خلال النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر، عندما أكمل البريطانيون ضمهم للبنجاب.\\nتستند السيخية على التعاليم الروحية لمؤسس الديانة وهو الغورو ناناك، وخلفائه التسعة من الغورو البشر. لقب غورو يعني بالهندية المعلم. أما الغورو غورو جوبيند سينغ الملقب بالعاشر، ساهم في الكثير من أجل السيخية، وكان إسهامه في الإضفاء المستمر للطابع الرسمي على الديانة التي أسسها أولًا الغورو السيخ ناناك ديف جي في القرن الخامس عشر إسهامًا جديرًا بالملاحظة. وسمى الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب كخليفة له، وبالتالي أنهى خط الغورو البشر وجعل ن الكتاب المقدس للسيخ جورو جرانث صاحب الدليل الروحي الديني والدينوي للسيخ. وترفض الديانة السيخية الادعاءات بأن أي تقليد ديني معين له احتكار للحقيقة المطلقة. وتطورت السيخية في أوقات الاضطهاد الديني. حيث تعرض اثنان من أتباع السيخ وهم الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور للتعذيب وأعدم من قبل حكام المغول بعد رفضهم اعتناق الإسلام. وأثار اضطهاد السيخ تأسيس الخالسا كطلب لحماية حرية الضمير والدين.\\nالتاريخ.\\nيرتبط تاريخ السيخية ارتباطًا وثيقًا بتاريخ منطقة البنجاب والوضع الاجتماعي السياسي في شمال غرب شبه القارة الهندية في القرن السادس عشر. منذ الحكم المغولي للهند على يد الإمبراطور جهانكير (1605-1707)، كانت السيخية في صراع مع قوانين إمبراطورية المغول، لأنها كانت تؤثر في التعاقب السياسي للمغول في حين تعتز بالأولياء من الإسلام. قُتل العديد من السيخ البارزين على يد حكام المغول لرفضهم الانصياع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ. من مجموع 10 من الغورو السيخ، عُذب وأُعدم اثنان من المعلمين أنفسهم (الغورو أرجان والغورو تيج بهادور)، وأقرباء مقربين للعديد من الغورو السيخ قُتلو بوحشية دون رحمة (مثل أبناء الغورو جوبيند سينغ البالغين من العمر 6 و9 سنوات)، إلى جانب العديد من الشخصيات الرئيسية الأخرى السيخية التي عُذبت وقُتلت (مثل باندا بهادور، بهاي ماتي داس، بهاي ساتي داس وباهاي ديالا)، على يد الحكام المغول المتجبرين لرفضهم الخضوع لأوامرهم، ومعارضتهم لاضطهاد السيخ والهندوس. بعد ذلك، عسكرت السيخية لمعارضة هيمنة المغول على أرضهم.\\nتميّز ظهور الكونفدرالية السيخية تحت حكم الأمراء والسيخ تحت حكم المهراجا رانجيت سينغ بالتسامح الديني والتعايش السلمي والتعددية مع المسيحيين والمسلمين والهندوس في مواقع السلطة. يعد تأسيس إمبراطورية السيخ عادةً ذروة السيخية على المستوى السياسي، خلال هذه الفترة جاءت إمبراطورية السيخ لتشمل كشمير (أقصى شمال شبه القارة الهندية)، ولداخ (إقليم اتحادي تديره الهند)، وبيشاور (هي عاصمة مقاطعة خيبر بختونخوا الباكستانية وأكبر مدنها). اعتنق عدد من الفلاحين المسلمين والهندوس السيخية. أخذ هاري سينغ نالوا، القائد العام لجيش السيخ على طول الحدود الشمالية الغربية، حدود إمبراطورية السيخ إلى مصب ممر خيبر (هو ممر جبلي في شمال غرب باكستان، على الحدود مع أفغانستان). دمجت الإدارة العلمانية لإمبراطورية السيخ إصلاحات عسكرية واقتصادية وحكومية مبتكرة.\\nشهدت الأشهر التي سبقت تقسيم الهند (تقسيم الهند البريطانية إلى دولتين مستقلتين، الهند وباكستان) سنة 1947، صراعًا حادًا في البنجاب (منطقة جيوسياسية وثقافية وتاريخية في جنوب آسيا، تحديدًا شمال شبه القارة الهندية، وتضم مناطق في شرق باكستان وشمال الهند) بين السيخ والمسلمين، شهد الهجرة الدينية الفعالة للسيخ البنجاب والهندوس من البنجاب الغربية مقابل هجرة دينية مماثلة للمسلمين البنجاب في شرق البنجاب. في الوقت الحاضر، يعيش غالبية السيخ في ولاية البنجاب في الهند.\\nالخمسة كاكارس أو الكافات الخمسة.\\nالخمسة كافات هم يصرون على الألتزام بها وعندهم من لا يلتزم بالكافات الخمس يصفوه بصفة باتت patitأي المرتد، ومن يدخل السيخية جديد يجعلوه يتعود عليها ويسموه المتكيف البطئ.\\nالغورو السيخ.\\nالغورو كلمة تعني المعلم وهم عشرة غورو للسيخية وهم:\\n]   \n",
